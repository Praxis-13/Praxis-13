# 🚀 Praxis

### Build real projects. Work like a startup. Represent 1337.

Praxis is a **project-driven club at 1337** where students **build big, real software projects** — not tutorials, not small demos.

If you want:

* something **serious** on your resume
* experience working in **real roles**
* to understand how **startups and tech teams actually work**

This is for you.

---

## 🧠 What is Praxis?

Praxis is a **startup-style incubator**, run as a **role-play**.

* You propose a project
* You defend it like an **investor pitch**
* You build a **real team**
* You work with **real workflows**
* You ship **real results**

No fake titles.
No “everyone does everything”.
No abandoned repos.

---

## 🏗️ What You Build

Projects at Praxis are:

* multi-week or multi-month
* public or private
* designed to **represent 1337**
* strong enough to go on a **resume**
* sometimes strong enough to become **startups**

You’re not joining a tech stack.
You’re joining a **project**.

---

## 👥 Real Roles (Not Just Code)

Every project uses **real startup positions**:

* 🧠 **Project Lead / CEO** – vision & direction
* 📋 **Product Manager** – roadmap & priorities
* 🏗️ **Tech Lead** – architecture & code quality
* 💻 **Developers** – implementation
* 🎨 **UI/UX** – design & user experience
* 🔍 **Reviewers / QA** – testing & quality

Roles depend on **what you actually contribute**.

---

## 🎭 The Role-Play: Investor & Pitch

Before a project starts:

* The idea is **presented**
* It’s **critiqued**
* It’s challenged like a **real investor meeting**

The goal is not to reject ideas —
the goal is to **make them stronger**.

This prepares you for:

* startup pitches
* technical interviews
* real-world pressure

---

## 🔓 Public vs 🔒 Private Projects

### 🌍 Public Projects

* Anyone can contribute
* Good for learning & visibility
* Open collaboration

### 🔐 Private Projects

* Application required
* Resume + motivation
* Sometimes a short interview
* You earn your place like in real teams

---

## 🧑‍💼 How You Join a Project

1. Create a profile
2. Show what you can do
3. Apply to a project
4. Get reviewed by the team
5. Join with a **defined role**

This mirrors:

* hiring
* team onboarding
* professional collaboration

---

## 🛠️ What You’ll Learn (For Real)

* How large tech projects are organized
* How to work with Git properly
* Pull requests, reviews, and feedback
* Task planning and ownership
* Team communication
* Responsibility and commitment

This is the stuff recruiters *actually care about*.

---

## 🎯 The Goal

* Build **serious projects**
* Give students **real experience**
* Create teams that work like startups
* Turn ideas into **products**
* Represent **1337** with quality work

Praxis is not about speed.
It’s about **depth**.
